# NTHU HEP Group

## Introduction

We're working on the experimental high energy physics (HEP-ex) with the ATLAS collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In our group, we've mainly contributed to the measurement of the Standard Model Higgs boson decaying into a W boson pair (HWW). We've just finished the first Run-2 publication for the HWW at $$\sqrt{s}=13$$ TeV with an intergrated luminosity of 36 $$\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$$ data. We are now focusing on the legacy HWW analysis with full Run2 dataset with an intergrated luminosity of 140 $$\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$$ collected from 2015 to 2018.

We are also involved in the searches for the dark matter produced in association with a Higgs boson decaying to two bottom quarks (Mono-Hbb). For hadrware part, we also contributed to the implementation of High-Granularity Timing Detector for the ATLAS phase-II upgrade. The upgrade projects are still ongoing!
